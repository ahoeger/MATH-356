#### Authors: Ava Hoeger, Gavin Butts, Quinn Yates, Teddy Jones, Madeigh Sandman, Antonio Garcia  

Description: This project aims to apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to the classification of handwritten characters using convolutional neural networks. There are 62 characters in the dataset, 0-9, A-Z, a-z. Using the trained network, character bounding and extraction is applied to a handwritten document and each character is predicted using the netork. Using autocorrection, the predicted result is altered and presented to the user.
